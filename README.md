- ## LnkBox is an non-opinionated Bookmark Manager that doesn't care how you want to organize your links, files, images, etc.

  ### Features:

  - ~~User defined tags!~~
  - Folders
  - Fast, reactive front-end
  - API Access
  - Self-Hosted
  - Cross Platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux)

### What does non-opinionated mean?

Basically, you're free to organize your entries in any way you want. Lnkbox doesn't force you into any specific organization method.

- You want to use tags? > _GREAT!_
- You want folders? > _AWESOME!_
- Both? > _AMAZING!_
- Neither! Just dump it all in the home page! > _SWEET! YOU DO YOU!_
